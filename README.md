# Unity Car Controller

## Description
The Unity Car Controller project provides a comprehensive car control system designed for Unity 3D, allowing for realistic vehicle physics and controls. This project includes scripts and configurations to simulate car behavior, including steering, acceleration, braking, and wheel updates. The system leverages Unity's `Rigidbody` and `WheelCollider` components to create a responsive and realistic driving experience.

## Features
- **Steering Mechanism**: Realistic steering for the front wheels.
- **Motor Force**: Simulates engine torque applied to the front wheels.
- **Braking System**: Implemented braking using space bar input.
- **Wheel Rotation**: Updates the position and rotation of the wheels to match the movement.
- **Center of Mass Adjustment**: Configurable center of mass to improve vehicle stability.
